              I have made one React project. Using components instead of plain

              My <i>name</i> is <strong class="rooster">Lethabo</strong> which I
              prefer people to call me by, but clearly I have more names than
              just my name. My <i>second</i> name I got it from my dad and
              <strong class="rooster">Tshepo</strong> was his first name, but he
              gave it to me as my <i>second</i> name so that makes my other name
              <i>(which is not on my ID)</i>
              <strong class="rooster">Junior</strong>. My <i>surname</i> is
              <strong class="rooster">Kgoele</strong> and I am in love with my
              <i>surname</i>, hearing <b>Mr. Kgoele</b> sounds professional and
              that, is what I highly encourage people to call me by.

            <h3>My Logo <i>(Nickname)</i></h3>
            <p>
              Long story short, in high school I was short, not the shortest but
              in <b>THAT</b> class, I was. I was given the nickname
              <b>Kortes</b> with no hesitation, which translates to "short".
              Instead of resenting the nickname, I use it to my advantage and
              created my <b><i>trademark</i></b> logo.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like to <i>"talk"</i> about coding especially on my

              found my logo.

            <p>
              There is nothing, I mean nothing I love more than watching
              football, Real Madrid is just my happy place, they are winners,
              But when is comes to Chelsea, it's a love and hate relationship.
              But no matter what I stay through the hard times, that is loyalty.

            </ul>
            <p>
              I love watching anime, which I highly think it's very much
              underrated till this day. That being said, Naruto is the greatest
              anime of all time.
            </p>
            <p>
              I love music too and Hip-Hop/Rap being my top 1. Same for Kendrick
              Lamar.
